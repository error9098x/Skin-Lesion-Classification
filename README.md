# Skin Lesion Image Classification

This GitHub repository contains image classification models for skin lesions using the ISIC dataset. The purpose of this project is to provide pre-trained models and code for classifying skin lesion images using four different models: ResNet152, VGG19, DenseNet201, and SqueezeNet1.1.

## Dataset
The models in this repository are trained on the ISIC dataset for the years 2019, 2018, and 2017. You can access the dataset for each year using the following links:
- [ISIC Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)
## Usage
To use the models for classification tasks, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Skin-Lesion-Image-Classification.git
   ```


3. Download the pre-trained model files (.pkl) from the following locations:
   - [ResNet152 Model](google.com)
   - [VGG19 Model](link-to-model-file)
   - [DenseNet201 Model](link-to-model-file)
   - [SqueezeNet1.1 Model](link-to-model-file)

4. Place the downloaded model files in the `models` directory.

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file for the desired model:
   - [ResNet152.ipynb](ResNet152.ipynb)
   - [VGG19.ipynb](VGG19.ipynb)
   - [DenseNet201.ipynb](DenseNet201.ipynb)
   - [SqueezeNet1.1.ipynb](SqueezeNet1.1.ipynb)

6. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train or evaluate the model.
